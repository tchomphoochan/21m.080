### Primary properties and methods:
#### Properties [unit]:
* frequency: [Hertz] the base frequency for the oscillator.
* detune: [Hertz) another method for altering the frequency. If you have two oscillators with the same frequency, detuning one by a small amount can generate a ‘thicker’ sound.
* type: [string] waveform for the oscillator. 
  * Basic waveforms available include "sine", "square", "sawtooth", "triangle"
  * You can also append a number to any of the waveforms specifying how many partials that waveform should contain, e.g. “sawtooth9” will contain the first nine partials of a sawtooth wave.
#### Methods:
* start(): begin generating the waveform
* connect( destination ): sends the output of the oscillator to the input of the specified destination 

## Additional properties and methods:
### Properties [unit]:
* mute: [boolean] mutes the oscillator
* partials: [number array] allows you to set the amplitude of the waveforms partials. 
* phase: [degrees 0-360] sets the starting position of the waveform. 
* volume: [dBFS -100 to 0] sets the output amplitude of the waveform

### Methods:
* get(): gets the oscillators attributes. Good for use with console.log()
